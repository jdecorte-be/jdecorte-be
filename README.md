# Hi, I’m John Decorte 👋

I’m a back-end software engineer based in Brussels.

I studied **software engineering and cybersecurity** at **42 Brussels** and **UCLouvain**, and I’ve worked at **Tweetz** and **Wilink**, building platforms for creators. In my free time, I enjoy exploring **cybersecurity**.
